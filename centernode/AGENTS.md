# Component spawn rules

**ALWAYS read [CENTERNODE-RULES.md](./CENTERNODE-RULES.md) before adding
or modifying any component spawn logic** (TallyUiLibraryPanel, variantPresets,
composite builders, isPropVisibleForVariant, etc.).

Three non-negotiable rules:
1. Variant pill ALWAYS in Props panel
2. Props ↔ Code bidirectional sync
3. Variant must flow through code

Breaking any of these = broken UX + lost user trust + wasted tokens.
