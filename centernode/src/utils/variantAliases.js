/**
 * Components where the conceptual "variant" maps to a real component prop
 * with a different name. The sidebar's synthetic `variant: <key>` is
 * rewritten under this prop name before the JSX is spawned, and the props
 * panel reads this map so the pill selector appears under the right key.
 *
 * Single source of truth — keep TallyUiLibraryPanel.jsx and utils/parser.js
 * importing from here.
