        title: "Full UI revamp — warm-dark + amber identity",
        items: [
          "Centernode now has its own visual identity instead of looking like a generic dark IDE. Layered warm-dark surfaces (canvas → surface → elevated → overlay) with amber as the signature accent across selection, primary actions, focus rings, and active states.",
          "Design primitives consolidated into CSS classes: `cn-btn`, `cn-input`, `cn-card`, `cn-chip`, `cn-segmented`, `cn-tabs-minimal`, `cn-row`, `cn-glass`. Every surface reaches for these instead of per-component Tailwind soups — one place to tweak, the whole app responds.",
          "Typography utilities in mono (`cn-mono-meta` for counts/IDs, `cn-eyebrow` for section headers, `cn-display` for titles). Geist Mono used decoratively in chrome so the tool reads designer-developer hybrid.",
          "Custom thin scrollbars that tint amber on hover. Border alphas warm-tinted so dividers read softer than typical cold-grey IDE chrome.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Architectural restructure — Activity Bar + Status Bar + Command Palette",
        items: [
          "**Left rail** (44px) — VSCode-style icon dock with Components / Layers / Search / Tokens. Click to open the corresponding floating panel, click again to collapse (canvas gets full width).",
          "**Status Bar** at the bottom — 22px glass strip with live mouse world coords (RAF-throttled), current tool state, selection summary, and zoom controls. Live caret blinks when editing inside a group, like a debugger HUD.",
          "**Command Palette (⌘K)** — fuzzy-search every action with icons + keyboard shortcuts + grouped by category (Canvas, Panels, Tools, View, Edit, Selection, Help). Arrow keys + Enter to run. Always-visible search trigger in the top header.",
          "**Top header** thinned to 40px. Brand logo gets a subtle amber glow; node count + selection chip show in mono as breadcrumb-style metadata.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Motion system — every interaction eases",
        items: [
          "Duration tokens (`--cn-dur-insta` 90ms → `--cn-dur-stage` 520ms) and easing tokens (`out-expo`, `in-expo`, `spring`, `smooth`) drive every transition in the app. Nothing snaps.",
          "Keyframe library: `cn-anim-fade`, `cn-anim-scale`, `cn-anim-left/right`, `cn-anim-pulse`, plus `cn-anim-stagger` that gives direct children sequential 30ms entrance delays.",
          "Press feedback baked into `cn-btn` — every button compresses to scale 0.97 on `:active` for tactile feel.",
          "`@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` collapses everything to 0.01ms — accessibility-respectful.",
        ],

      {
        title: "Inspector — flat sectioned layout",
        items: [
          "Cards dropped from group / component / multi-select inspectors. Sections are now `cn-eyebrow` + content + `cn-divider` — reads like a doc, not nested boxes.",
          "Tabs use the minimal text + thin underline pattern (`cn-tabs-minimal`) across Properties / Code on groups, Props / Code / Tokens on components, and POD / Component in the Tokens panel. No chip, no glow.",
          "Identity rows: icon chip (amber-tinted) + inline-editable name + mono meta line (`2 children · ↓ column`) — same pattern across Group / Component / Multi-select for total visual consistency.",
          "Inputs transparent by default — just a thin border. Hover lights the border up; focus turns it amber with a soft ring. No filled chrome competing with the value.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Autolayout — Figma-dense grid + Appearance",
        items: [
          "Autolayout section is now a tight grid: direction segmented at the top, then `AlignGrid` 3×3 picker next to gap + padding scrub inputs. Active dot in the grid context-aware — for Column groups, alignment maps to columns; for Row, to rows.",
          "`ScrubInput` icon variant — single bordered field with leading icon + tiny mono label (`GAP 12`, `PAD 0`). Click-and-drag the icon to scrub, or type. Arrow keys ↑↓ to bump (shift +10).",
          "**Appearance section** — fill (color picker or image upload via data URL), border radius, stroke (width + color). All optional; default to a transparent frame with 0 radius and no stroke. Code preview emits new props live in JSX / Tailwind / HTML formats.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Modals — unified wrapper with proper enter/exit",
        items: [
          "New `<Modal>` wrapper owns the open/close orchestration so every popup (Changelog, Syntax hint, Command Palette) has the same motion. Panel scales 0.97 → 1 with spring easing, backdrop fades + blurs independently. Close runs in reverse before unmount.",
          "Modal panel background now matches the inspector sidebar (`cn-surface`) — visually the same layer, separation comes from the dimmed/blurred backdrop instead of a brighter panel color.",
          "`data-overlay` attribute on every modal — global wheel handler detects it and skips canvas pan/zoom, so scrolling inside a modal doesn't leak through to the canvas behind.",
          "Esc to close, listener bound only while mounted. Pointer events disable during the exit transition so quick clicks don't bounce off a phantom backdrop.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Selection chrome — pixel-accurate + zoom-invariant",
        items: [
          "Selection ring stroke uses `box-shadow: 0 0 0 (1/zoom)px` so the line stays a constant ~1px on screen at any canvas zoom. No more fat blue lines when zoomed in.",
          "Resize handles always sit OUTSIDE the selection ring (`offset` prop on ResizeHandles), consistent on both single components and group containers.",
          "Single-component label: just the node name, no dot indicator, no chrome icons. 8px constant gap to the indicator regardless of zoom. Hidden entirely when canvas zoom < 100%.",
          "Group / Component identity ring color, edit-mode dashed ring, multi-select frame, marquee drag, hover ring — all amber, all 1px-on-screen. Cohesive selection language.",

        title: "⌘Z undo / redo",
        items: [
          "Cmd / Ctrl+Z reverts node changes; Cmd / Ctrl+Shift+Z (or Cmd+Y) redoes. History is debounced 250ms — drag and scrub mutations all share one snapshot per resting state, so undo unwinds in logical units instead of per-frame.",
          "Snapshot stack capped at 50. Skip when an input is focused so the browser's native field-level undo still works for typo correction.",
        ],
      },
      {
        title: "Misc fixes",
        items: [
          "Drag a single component from anywhere on its body (not just the label). 3px threshold before drag commits — tiny twitch = click, not jitter.",
          "Group drag works when padding = 0 (the old empty-area check meant zero-padding groups were undraggable).",
          "Performance — `useCallback` for the hot handlers + `React.memo` on `PreviewNode`. Dragging one node no longer re-renders all siblings.",
          "Layer panel + LayerRow: chevron rotates with spring easing; rows use `cn-row` primitive for uniform hover/active behaviour.",
          "Tokens panel: now matches Library/Layers panel structure (h-10 header, minimal tabs, flat sections with dividers) instead of looking like a different system.",

        items: [

          "Theme toggle (sun / moon icon) in the top header flips the `.dark` class on `<html>`. Choice persists to `localStorage` so reloads keep the picked theme; bootstrap script in `layout.tsx` applies it before React mounts (no flash-of-wrong-theme).",
          "Canvas dot-grid swaps colour with theme — dots stay subtle in both modes instead of burning in dark.",
          "Previously: centernode was light-only, which clashed with dark POD components dropped onto canvas. Now: canvas chrome and component canvas-mode are independent — sidebar mini-previews still have their own light/dark toggle.",

        items: [

          "Esc clears selection. Single-select still works exactly as before — multi-select is purely additive.",
          "When ≥2 nodes are selected, the per-node blue ring + label dots disappear. A single group-bounding frame replaces them, so the canvas stays visually clean instead of cluttered with overlapping chrome.",

        title: "Auto-layout — Figma-style Row / Column arrangement",
        items: [
          "Right inspector shows an `Auto layout` panel when ≥2 nodes are selected. Pick `Row` (horizontal) or `Column` (vertical), set a `Gap` (px), click — selected nodes re-flow with uniform spacing.",
          "Anchored to the leftmost (Row) or topmost (Column) node — your sort order is preserved by current X/Y position, so you don't have to re-pick the order.",
          "Each node keeps its own size; only x/y change. No flexbox container — the layout is baked into node positions.",

        items: [
          "`Distribute H` / `Distribute V` buttons appear in the multi-select panel when ≥3 nodes are selected. Pins first + last in place, redistributes the middle nodes so inter-node gaps are equal along the chosen axis.",
          "Useful when you've roughly arranged nodes but spacing is uneven — one click and they snap to even rhythm.",
        ],
      },

        title: "Bulk actions on multi-selection",
        items: [

          "Underline indicator renders for Active state only (matched Figma `<div h-0>` invisibility for inactive). Fixed `bg-success-default` → `bg-success` (the `-default` suffix is implicit when the color has a DEFAULT key in the preset).",
